# Random Forest Classifier

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UMCUGenetics/ONCODE_MC/79bd5bd67ade0bfc835885702b0d2175ce4a931f)

## Introduction
In this session we will use an miRNA expression dataset that contains 714 expression signatures across 29 tumor/normal pairs measured in human cervical tissue. 

We will use this dataset to perform some necessary pre-processing steps, feature scaling/normalization, and train a RandomForest classifier with Python. We will also shortly experiment with other different machine learning methods in the end.
