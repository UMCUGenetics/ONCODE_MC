## Introduction
In this session we will use an miRNA expression dataset that contains 714 expression signatures across 29 tumor/normal pairs measured in human cervical tissue. We will use this dataset to perform some necessary pre-processing steps, feature scaling/normalization, and train a RandomForest classifier with Python. We will also shortly experiment with other different machine learning methods in the end.
