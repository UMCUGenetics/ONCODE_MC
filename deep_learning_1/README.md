# Deep Learning I.

## Quick Start Guide

1. First you need to mount the shared GDrive dataset before we load the files. Go to the Shared Folder in your Google Drive (see link sent)
3. Right click on the folder (so you don't open it but you see a pop-up window with a list of actions), click on 'Add shortcut to Drive' (My Drive is selected by default so keep it that way).
4. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/github/UMCUGenetics/ONCODE_MC/blob/master/deep_learning_1/Deep%20Learning%20I.ipynb
5. Go to the [2] code paragraph to quickly test if the mounting has worked for you
